Implementation of various search algorithms and cell decomposition techniques. Ultimate goal is to be able to provide a map of the global environment in a binary image format, and a top-down outline of the robot geometry and to then be able to find a path from point (x1, y1) to point (x2, y2) efficiently.

Applications include robot path planning, robot arm manipulation etc.
